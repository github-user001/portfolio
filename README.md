## Courses That I Have Created

### Udacity (working at ASG @ Google)

#### Android Fundamentals
Link: [Android Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/new-android-fundamentals--ud851)
##### Supplemental Material

* [Sunshine Application Source Code](https://github.com/udacity/ud851-Sunshine)
	* I rewrote this entire application in order to make code much more clear, hide complexity, and even added in [interactive TODOs](https://github.com/udacity/ud851-Sunshine/blob/student/S01.01-Exercise-CreateLayout/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_forecast.xml#L17-L18) to make it easier for students to follow the lessons within Android Studio

* [Example Applications](https://github.com/udacity/ud851-Exercises )
	* I wanted to demonstrate concepts in a much more isolated fashion in order to decrease the cognitive load on the students. I wrote a majority of these applications in order to do so.
